This directory contain prototype software related to Pune transit 
project.

To compile and execute use following instructions. This software is 
tested only on GNU/Linux Ubuntu 8.10.

$ make
g++ -Wall -g main.cpp routes.cpp -o rgen.exe

Before compiling and running the executable, you probably want to 
edit source code file 'main.cpp'. The input data file names are hard
coded in main function. Sample input data routes-sample.csv and 
trips-sample.csv is available in the directory. Change the file names 
in main function (file: main.cpp) to use sample input data.

If you have with you schedule data of any public transit organisation 
then you may use file names containing the data.

Keep all input data set files in same directory as executable.

$ ./rgen.exe 

If program exits successfully, it will generated HTML pages 
(one index.html page and many routes pages) in subdirectory 'html'. 
You can open index.html in your favorite web browser.

$ firefox index.html &

Subdirectory 'html' also contain sample HTML pages 'sample_index.html'
and 'sample_route.html'.
